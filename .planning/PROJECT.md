# Draupnir — LLM Gateway Abstraction

## What This Is

Draupnir is an existing TypeScript + Bun + DDD service that currently speaks directly to Bifrost API Gateway for LLM virtual-key management, usage tracking, and chat-completion proxying. This project introduces an `ILLMGatewayClient` abstraction so business logic no longer imports Bifrost types, and extracts the `BifrostClient` into a standalone `packages/bifrost-sdk/` workspace package so future gateway backends (OpenRouter, Gemini, mocks) can be swapped in at build time without touching the application layer.

## Core Value

**Gateway-neutral application code (v1.0); proactive cost control via alerts, analytics, and reports (v1.3); v1.4 hardens operations with unified scheduling, ORM-agnostic Alerts, and CI guardrails on every PR.**

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ `ILLMGatewayClient` interface with camelCase DTOs, adapter, mock, barrel export — v1.0
- ✓ All 7 application services migrated to `ILLMGatewayClient` with tests — v1.0
- ✓ `bifrostVirtualKeyId` → `gatewayKeyId` renamed across domain and repos — v1.0
- ✓ `packages/bifrost-sdk/` workspace package with BifrostClient, config, types, errors — v1.0
- ✓ All 19 page handler classes unit-tested; all 25 Inertia page routes covered — v1.1
- ✓ Complete i18n migration and standardizing all API responses to English — v1.1
- ✓ `BifrostSyncService` + `usage_records` SQLite schema for local analytics reads — v1.2
- ✓ Six production dashboard charts (Cost, Tokens, Models) using Recharts — v1.2
- ✓ Role-scoped analytics (ADMIN/MANAGER/MEMBER) with key-level isolation — v1.2
- ✓ Period-over-period comparison badges and PDF export via browser print — v1.2
- ✓ Usage alerts foundation, webhook alerts CRUD/history/resend, and signed delivery persistence — v1.3
- ✓ Per-key/per-model cost breakdown with token efficiency metrics — v1.3
- ✓ Scheduled server-side PDF usage reports via Croner + Playwright — v1.3
- ✓ ORM-agnostic `UsageRepository` with declarative `AggregateSpec` and `IQueryBuilder.aggregate` (Atlas-ready) — v1.3
- ✓ Unified `IScheduler` + Croner adapter; scheduled work registered via `registerJobs()` — v1.4
- ✓ Alerts repositories and services migrated to Atlas; `IAlertNotifier` / in-memory fixtures — v1.4
- ✓ CI pipeline: parallel guardrail jobs (typecheck, lint/format, tests+coverage, drift, routes, DI, E2E smoke, commitlint) — v1.4

### Active

- [ ] Complete full migration of all legacy Drizzle repositories to Gravito Atlas (v2)
- [ ] Implement `OpenRouterGatewayAdapter` (v2)
- [ ] Extend `ILLMGatewayClient` to cover raw chat-completion proxying (v2)

### Out of Scope

- **Abstracting `ProxyModelCall` behind `ILLMGatewayClient`** — Raw chat-completion proxying is a different concern than virtual-key management.
- **Runtime gateway switching** — Gateway is a compile-time/ServiceProvider decision.
- **Database schema migration for `bifrost_virtual_key_id` column** — TS-only rename.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `ProxyModelCall` stays on Bifrost | Chat-completion proxying is out of scope for key management | ✅ Completed |
| `bifrost-sdk` lives as a workspace package | Keeps development loop in one repo, versioned together | ✅ Completed |
| i18n migration for all page handlers | Ensures consistent English-only API and localized UI | ✅ Completed |
| Cached aggregation (SQLite local reads) | Avoids 500ms-5s Bifrost API latency; enables sub-100ms UI | ✅ Completed |
| PDF export via `window.print()` | Simplest implementation with high visual fidelity; no new deps | ✅ Completed |
| HMAC-SHA256 Webhook Signing | Standard industry pattern for message integrity and authenticity | ✅ Completed |
| Declarative `AggregateSpec` | Decouples repository logic from ORM-specific syntax (now using Atlas) | ✅ Completed |
| Playwright for Server-side PDF | Native headless browser support; consistent layout with dashboard | ✅ Completed |
| `IScheduler` port + CronerScheduler | Single lifecycle for cron/interval work; retry/backoff; test `FakeScheduler` | ✅ Completed |
| Alerts ORM-agnostic + `IAlertNotifier` | Same pattern as Usage; email/webhook strategies; DI-less tests | ✅ Completed |
| GitHub Actions CI guardrails | Required checks aligned with docs; no regressions without human override | ✅ Completed |

## Current milestone

**None defined.** Run `/gsd-new-milestone` to capture goals, research, requirements, and the next roadmap slice.

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
